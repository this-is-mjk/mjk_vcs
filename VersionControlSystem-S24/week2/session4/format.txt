->FORMAT of Objects

1-> BLOB 

blob (length_of_content)(NULL_BYTE)(content)

2-> TREE

tree (length_of_content)(NULL_BYTE)(file1_MODE) (file1_NAME)(NULL_BYTE)(objID1)(file2_MODE) (file2_NAME)(NULL_BYTE)(objID2)(file3_NAME)(NULL_BYTE)..........

content here is after null byte, so it's lenght has to be considered 

3-> COMMIT

commit (lenght_of_content)(NULL_BYTE)tree (TREE_ID)
author (NAME) (EMAIL) (TIME_STRING)
committer (NAME) (EMAIL) (TIME_STRING)

Again content here is after null byte 

* Also if you are implementing ahead of root-commit then format of commit will include a parent above author => parent (PARENT_COMMIT_ID)
