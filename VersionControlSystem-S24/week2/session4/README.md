## README 
1. You will find some helper func and snippets in helperFunctions
2. There are three images alongside. You are currently implementing "Only_Files_And_Root_Commit.jpeg"
3. if you have time, then maybe you can try "Subsequent_Commits.png" implementation by including parent in commit content and updating HEAD after each commit
4. We will talk about general case with both files and nested directory in next session but you may get hints from "General_Case.png"
5. Do not worry much about format of files(that is "blob 6Hello"), Try Writing code that succesfully saves the files, tree and commit with author info
6. I have included exact format in "format.txt"
